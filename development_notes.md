## Notes for developers' use

# Research process

## Initial ideas

Google / Eventbrite / Ticketmaster

Copernicus

Space/asteroid APIs

Tabletop RPG (https://www.dnd5eapi.co/docs/)
- simulator? (playing with AI)
- GM (AI leading a team of irl people through a game of DnD)
- Board thing for an irl GM (no AI)

## Current idea

Tabletop RPG!

Index:
- Create game
- Load game
- FAQ / I'm lost

Board for GM to create a:
- game with a party of players etc
- items, spells, monsters, ... from API

Keep track of inventories, health points, ...

Have a GM page with all the info and a player page with only the player's info ?

(Maybe at some point AI chatbot for "generate a quest" or "generate a monster interaction" or something)

## Tables:
Player table (the things you need as soon as the game loads, base info every player has)
Columns:
id
name
species
class
abilities
alignment
skill
current_health
max_health
game_id
